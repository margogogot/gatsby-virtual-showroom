  Virtual Showroom
</h1>

This app was created as a virtual showroom to showcase outdoor products in 2020 for Forms+Surfaces.

I used a Gatsby starter to get a head start on the boilerplate and the webgl showroom itself is stored on a separate Amazon S3 store since the models were way too big to deploy here in git.
